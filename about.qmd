My research focuses on leveraging open data and R, the most powerful open source software available today, to provide evidence-based solutions to various real-world problems.

The reason why I chose this research direction is that in today's digital age, massive amounts of data will enable all kinds of enterprises, organizations and governments to gradually shift from the past process-driven model to a new data-driven model. Based on this background, mastering the ability to let "data speak" will become an essential skill for our generation.
